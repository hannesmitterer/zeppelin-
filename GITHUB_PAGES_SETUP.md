# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Modern Static Site Implementation

The Zeppelin Home website has been redesigned as a modern, fully static HTML site that showcases four distinct approaches to smart home automation.

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages (in left sidebar)
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically deploy the static site to the `gh-pages` branch

**Note**: The new static site deployment workflow automatically builds and deploys the site when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### 2. Site Structure

- **Homepage**: `index.html` (modern static HTML at repository root)
- **Media Assets**: `media/` directory (SVG logo and graphics)
- **Deployment**: `.github/workflows/static-pages.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **No Build Requirements**: Pure static files, no Jekyll or build process needed

### 3. Expected URL

The site is available at:
`https://hannesmitterer.github.io/zeppelin-/`
